# UTK Libraries Ontologies

Local ontologies in use by the University of Tennessee Libraries to describe works, files, and other repository content.

## Ontologies

[University of Tennessee Digital Initiatives Files and Works Ontology](https://ontology.lib.utk.edu/works): Ontology for 
the University of Tennessee Libraries to state relationships about works and the files they consist of.  This ontology 
does not intend to supersede more established ontologies but instead exists to state relationships when established properties cannot be identified.

[University of Tennessee Digital Initiatives Role Terms Ontology](https://ontology.lib.utk.edu/roles): Ontology for the 
University of Tennessee Libraries to state relationships between people and works.  This ontology exists because m3
profiles defined by Houndstooth and Allison Flex cannot support both URIs and strings.  For that reason, this ontology 
exists and closely follows marcrelators.  The key difference is that this ontology is defined to work with values that 
are strings only.
