    Ontology for the the University of Tennessee Libraries to state relationships between people and works.  This ontology
    exists because m3 profiles defined by Houndstooth cannot support both URIs and strings.  For that reason, this ontology
    exists and closely follows marcrelators.  The key difference is that this ontology is defined to work with values
    that are strings only."""@en ;
